# Jamstack Conference - Practical introduction to relational databases companion site

This site is a companion site for the workshop I held on 7th October at Jamstack Conference.

It is deployed to Netlify, and can be accessed on https://jam21.j7y.co.

If you'd rather run it locally, or the above site is no longer active for any reason, clone this repository, install dependencies with `npm install` from the root of the directory, and run it with `npm run dev`. That will spin up a server and you should be able to access it on http://localhost:3000 or similar port.

## Note
Some of the pages might still be missing content. I'm copying and publishing them as I go, and then should all be up to date by the end of the week.
