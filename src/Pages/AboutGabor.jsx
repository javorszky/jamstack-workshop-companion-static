            <h2 className="subtitle">About Gabor</h2>
            <p>I work as a senior backend engineer for a fintech company in New York through an agency in Miami while living in the UK.</p>
            <p>My day to day is spent knee deep in golang and postgres, though sadly I don't touch the front end much. I know enough of html and css to figure out what's going on, but more advanced concepts escape me.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I do woodworking and ride my motorbike when the weather is passable.</p>
