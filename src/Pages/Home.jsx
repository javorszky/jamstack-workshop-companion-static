            <p>This site is a companion to the workshop I held on 7th October 2021 on Jamstack Conference. It has all of the same concepts, plus a few extras that I didn't have time to share with you.</p>
            <p>If you'd like to view this site offline, it's at <a href="https://github.com/javorszky/jamstack-workshop-companion-static">https://github.com/javorszky/jamstack-workshop-companion-static</a> with instructions on how to get it running locally.</p>
            <p>With that, choose from the menu on the left to read about any of the topics in more details.</p>
            <p>Hope you find this useful.</p>
